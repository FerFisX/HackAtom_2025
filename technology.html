            <h2 class="section-title">Basic Principles of Nuclear Fission</h2>
            <p class="text-content">Nuclear fission is the process by which the nucleus of a heavy atom splits into two or more smaller nuclei, releasing a large amount of energy. This process is harnessed in nuclear power plants to generate electricity.</p>
            <p class="text-content">When a neutron strikes a uranium-235 atom, the atom splits, releasing more neutrons that in turn strike other atoms, creating a controlled chain reaction.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Types of Nuclear Reactors</h2>
            <p class="text-content">There are different designs of nuclear reactors, each with its own characteristics regarding fuel, moderator, and coolant. The most common are Pressurized Water Reactors (PWR) and Boiling Water Reactors (BWR).</p>
            <p class="text-content">These reactors are designed with multiple safety layers to prevent the release of radioactive material and ensure safe operation.</p>
