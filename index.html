                        Nuclear medicine uses small amounts of radioactive substances (radiopharmaceuticals) to diagnose and evaluate a variety of diseases at their earliest stages. Techniques such as <strong>PET (Positron Emission Tomography)</strong> and <strong>SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography)</strong> allow doctors to visualize the functioning of organs and tissues, identifying problems such as cancer, heart disease, neurological and bone disorders with unprecedented clarity. Isotopes like Technetium-99m are crucial in this field.

                        Nuclear technology offers powerful tools in the fight against cancer. <strong>Radiotherapy</strong> uses high-energy radiation beams precisely targeted to destroy cancer cells, minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissue.

                    <p class="text-content">
                        In addition, <strong>Radionuclide Therapies (RNT)</strong> are an innovative treatment modality. They involve the administration of radioactive isotopes that selectively target tumor cells, releasing radiation directly into them. Examples include Iodine-131 for thyroid cancer or Lutetium-177 for neuroendocrine tumors.

                        <strong>The Cyclotron and the Future of Radiotherapy:</strong> A cyclotron enables the production of very short-lived isotopes used in some advanced treatments. In specific and highly controlled cases, therapies are being developed that could significantly reduce exposure times, such as replacing prolonged chemotherapy sessions with more concentrated and effective treatments, under specialist supervision.

                        Food irradiation is a safe and effective technology that uses controlled doses of ionizing radiation to improve the safety and extend the shelf life of products. This process eliminates or drastically reduces pathogenic bacteria (such as *Salmonella* and *E. coli*), parasites, and harmful insects, controlling spoilage and sprouting in products like potatoes and onions.

                    <p class="text-content">
                        Approved by international organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the FAO, irradiation contributes to global food safety, reduces waste, and facilitates international food trade. It does not make food radioactive, it simply "cleans" it of harmful microorganisms.
